## Laravel API and Angular frontend using the Laravel API Boilerplate (JWT Edition)

Laravel API Boilerplate is a ready-to-use "starting pack" that you can use to build your first API in seconds. As you can easily imagine, it is built on top of the awesome Laravel Framework.

It also benefits from three pacakages:

* JWT-Auth - [tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
* Dingo API - [dingo/api](https://github.com/dingo/api)
* Laravel-CORS [barryvdh/laravel-cors](http://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors)

This little project use Angular for the frontend and it's a simple CRUD with authentication using JWT (Json-Web-Tokens). You can add, modify, delete and show books as a wishlist.

## Usage:

* `composer install`
* `bower install`
* create a database.sqlite on the database folder
* `php artisan migrate`

That's it!
